As a member of the Executive Committee of the a:gender (the Civil Service network for trans and intersex staff), I took
it upon myself to redesign our website, to make it more accessible and easier to modify. In the past, it was hosted on
Wix, using their WYSIWYG editor to make changes. This may well have worked well in the past, but it was proving entirely
unwieldy and making it much harder to make changes.

The new website is built using 11ty[^11ty], a static site generator written for Node.js, making it easier to create and
update content with Markdown. It is based upon the CSLGBT+ website[^cslgbt], with lots of love, and with a similar 
design language to [GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/) for a professional look.
