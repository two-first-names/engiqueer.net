After a few attempts, I am rebuilding my website! This iteration might last a bit longer, but who knows. Sporadic
updates, dubious quality blog posts, more to follow. :)

### About Me

So who am I? Good question. I'm Joe, I'm a Civil Servant in the United Kingdom; currently working for the Government 
Digital Service. I build things that help people, in theory. Right now I am a Site Reliability Engineer on the [GOV.UK 
Pay](https://payments.service.gov.uk/) project, a service that helps the government take payments from users.

I am a trade union representative; both for PCS[^PCS] and UTAW[^UTAW], I do my best to look after the interests of those
I work for and further the interests of the trade union movement as a whole. At GDS, I am the LGBTQ+ Network Lead,
and use my position to work with LGBTQ+ colleagues and allies, as well as leadership, to ensure we are all treated
equitably and with respect.

Outside of work, I'm just a nerd (I guess I'm a nerd in work too). I play video games, board games, and tabletop role 
playing games. And I am the proud parent of a delightful Corgi/Poodle cross, Peggy!
